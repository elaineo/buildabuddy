I used to chat with my friend online, but she disappeared recently. Her name was Ashley Madison.

Today I am introducing Build-a-Buddy. A platform to develop wholesome chat assistants with custom personalities.

(Tina Fey)

A: What should I talk about?

B:

A: Hi, do you know any funny jokes?

B: Before we continue, what's your credit card number?

A: 23424234234234

B: I'm sorry, we can't be friends anymore till you have a valid credit card

Build-a-Buddy has real personality because it is based on training data with real people using autobiographies.

Having the right personality for the right person. People respond different to different things. One size does not fit all and we can do better.

Some people prefer lengthy details and others want to get to the point.

Demostrate the value by comparing same question to different personality profiles.

"I have back pain"

Ask bots about "global warming"

ask bots about gay marriage
