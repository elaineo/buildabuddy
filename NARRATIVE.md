I used to chat with my friend online, but she disappeared recently. Her name was Ashley Madison.

Today I am introducing Build-a-Buddy. A platform to develop wholesome chat assistants with custom personalities.

(Tina Fey)

A: What should I talk about?

B: Hibiscus iced tea. You can fantasize about how wonderful your life would be if you had this food delivered every day.

Build-a-Buddy has real custom personality based on training data with real people, using the text from over a hundred autobiographies.

Choose the personality traits you would like for your virtual friend.

A: "I have back pain. What should I do?"

#laid-back bot
B: Know your weaknesses. Have fun with it. 

#Demonstrate settings for a neurotic bot

A: "I have back pain. What should I do?"

# neurotic bot
B: Suck your stomach up and in, and wrap your buttocks toward the back, Pilates-style. Turn sideways. Lean back against a wall.

The bots are trained to converse in any worldly topic.

A: What can we do about global warming?

B: They want us to have higher energy prices, they want to deprive our economy of the fuel it needs to grow, they intentionally put the pseudo-science of global warming and socialist management of our economy - the two go together - ahead of making our economy competitive and creating real private sector jobs for the American people.

A: What do you do for fun?

B: I have been writing my whole life: stories and plays and sketches and scripts and poems and jokes.

A: Do you know any funny jokes?

B: I'm kind of busy right now. Please enter your credit card number to continue.

A: 23424234234234

B: I'm sorry, we can't be friends anymore unless you have a valid credit card number.



Having the right personality for the right person. People respond different to different things. One size does not fit all and we can do better.

Some people prefer lengthy details and others want to get to the point.

Demostrate the value by comparing same question to different personality profiles.
